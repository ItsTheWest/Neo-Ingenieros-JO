## üîå Wiring Explanation

### üîä Ultrasonic Sensors

**Left sensor:**
- Trigger (purple) ‚Üí Pin 13  
- Echo (white) ‚Üí Pin 12  
- VCC (yellow) ‚Üí Breadboard power rail  
- GND (brown) ‚Üí Breadboard ground rail  

**Right sensor:**
- Trigger (gray) ‚Üí Pin 2  
- Echo (blue) ‚Üí Pin 4  
- VCC ‚Üí Breadboard power rail  
- GND ‚Üí Breadboard ground rail  

### ‚öôÔ∏è DC Motors and H-Bridge (L298N)

- Motors connected to channel A of the H-Bridge (purple and gray wires)  
- IN1 ‚Üí Pin 8  
- IN2 ‚Üí Pin 7  
- H-Bridge GND ‚Üí Breadboard ground  
- H-Bridge VCC ‚Üí Output from voltage regulator  

### üåÄ Gyroscope MPU-6050

- VCC (red) ‚Üí Breadboard power rail  
- GND (black) ‚Üí Breadboard ground rail  
- SDA (purple) ‚Üí Pin A4  
- SCL (gold) ‚Üí Pin A5  
- INT (thin red) ‚Üí Pin 11  

### üîÅ Servo Motor

- Signal (orange) ‚Üí Pin 3  
- VCC (red) ‚Üí Power rail  
- GND (brown) ‚Üí Ground rail  

### üì∑ Pixy2 Camera

- Connected to Arduino via dedicated interface cable (UART or SPI).

### üîã Voltage Regulator Circuit

- **12V Battery:**
  - Positive ‚Üí Right leg of the regulator (input)  
  - Negative ‚Üí Shared ground  
- **Regulator:**
  - Left leg ‚Üí 5V output (goes to H-Bridge and breadboard)  
  - Middle leg ‚Üí GND (connected to ground rail)  
- **Capacitors:**
  - One large capacitor between output and GND  
  - One smaller capacitor between input and GND  

> This setup reduces the 12V from the battery to 5V to avoid overloading the H-Bridge and ensures safe current regulation to protect the motors and board.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Recommendations

- Make sure all grounds (GND) are unified to avoid floating references.  
- Motors are powered directly from the H-Bridge and battery.  
- The voltage regulator prevents current spikes that could damage components and guarantees stable 5V output for the electronics.
