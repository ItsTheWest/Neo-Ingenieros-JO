Component documentation
===

This directory contains technical documentation (datasheets) of the electromechanical components used in the self-driven vehicle developed for the WRO Future Engineers 2022 competition.

Each file provides specifications, electrical characteristics, pin configurations, and usage guidelines of the components involved in the system's control and sensing mechanisms. These documents are essential for integration, troubleshooting, and future development.

Included components:

- **Arduino UNO**: Main microcontroller used for program execution and peripheral control.
- **Breadboarding**: Used for rapid prototyping and testing of circuit connections.
- **Controller module L9110**: Dual-channel motor driver module.
- **HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor**: Used for distance measurement and obstacle detection.
- **MPU-6050**: Motion sensor that combines accelerometer and gyroscope.
- **Micro servo motor**: Used for mechanical movements such as steering.
- **Pixy2 Cam**: Vision sensor for color-based object tracking and line following.
