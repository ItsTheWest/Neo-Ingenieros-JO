Component documentation
===

This directory contains technical documentation (datasheets) of the electromechanical components used in the self-driven vehicle developed for the WRO Future Engineers 2022 competition.

Each file provides specifications, electrical characteristics, pin configurations, and usage guidelines of the components involved in the system's control and sensing mechanisms. These documents are essential for integration, troubleshooting, and future development.

Included components:

- **Arduino UNO**: Main microcontroller used for program execution and peripheral control.
- **DC Motor**: Converts electrical energy into mechanical rotation for propulsion and actuation.
- **Breadboarding**: Used for rapid prototyping and testing of circuit connections.
- **HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor**: Used for distance measurement and obstacle detection.
- **MPU-6050**: Motion sensor that combines accelerometer and gyroscope.
- **Micro servo motor**: Used for mechanical movements such as steering.
- **Pixy2 Cam**: Vision sensor for color-based object tracking and line following.
- **Capacitors**: Provide voltage smoothing and noise filtering in power lines and signal circuits.
- **Voltage Regulators**: Ensure stable voltage output to critical components, protecting against fluctuations.
- **HG7881 H-Bridge Motor Driver**: Dual H-bridge module for controlling DC motors in both directions with speed modulation.
- **L293D** : Quadruple H-bridge motor driver IC that allows bidirectional control of up to two DC motors, ideal for basic robotic movement and direction control.
