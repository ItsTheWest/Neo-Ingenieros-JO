Models Directory
===

This directory is for the files for **models used by 3D printers, laser cutting machines, and CNC machines** to produce the vehicle elements.

It includes all the digital design files required to fabricate structural and mechanical parts of the vehicle, such as:

- Chassis components
- Sensor or camera mounts
- Motor brackets
- Enclosures or protective covers

Files may include formats like `.stl`, `.obj`, `.step` for 3D printing, or `.dxf`, `.svg` for laser cutting/CNC milling.

If there is nothing to add to this location, the directory can be removed.
